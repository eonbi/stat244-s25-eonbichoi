# Pit Stop Decisions in Formula 1

Our project explores the relationship between pit stops and variables such as lap time, lap number, tire age, and type of tire. These are factors that often play a clear role in when teams choose to make a stop. We are interested in predicting the probability of making a pit stop during the 2024 Miami Grand Prix, considering factors such as lap time, track progress, tire age, and the type of tire used. 

The data used in this study were obtained from the f1dataR R package that accesses Formula 1 data via the [FastF1 Python library](https://docs.fastf1.dev/). The dataset includes lap-by-lap session data from the 2024 Miami Grand Prix and comprise 1,111 laps and 32 variables. These variables include driver details, lap times, pit in/out times, tire information, and track status. More detailed information about this package can be found in its [API documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/f1dataR/f1dataR.pdf).


## Some visualizations

The frequency of pit stops across laps during the 2024 Miami Grand Prix. It helps visualize when teams tend to stop during the race.

The density of lap times for each team during the race. We can compare the performance and variability in lap times across different teams.
